# lepton-uf-app-e2e

Leptos host + Playwright for the product crates in this workspace:
[`lepton-shell`](../lepton-shell/), [`lepton-app`](../lepton-app/), and
[`lepton-auth-app`](../lepton-auth-app/).

Nothing here is a fixture. `src/app.rs` mounts `UserAppRoutes`, `LeptonAuthRoutes`,
and `AppBarUserMenu` through the `uf-integrations` shell slot, the same way a product
binary does. If a spec passes against this host, the composition a host would ship
works.

Boot uses tolerant in-memory Valence, because SQLite cannot run the Surreal-shaped
unique probes that identity schemas emit. The Higgs SSR factory allows internal
System minting for signup and password reset, matching
`ProcessValenceFactory::as_higgs_factory` on the embedded host.

**Do not copy this boot into a production host.** Lab-only choices that must stay here:

- `SessionManagerLayer.with_secure(false)` (localhost cookies)
- `POST /api/test/seed-data` (System Valence seed)
- Higgs factory that allows System-shaped actors without `external_actor_json_policy`
- Forced `VALENCE_OWNERSHIP_*=0` and the tolerant mem backend

Production hosts need `Secure` cookies, no seed route, and a factory policy that
matches the kit SECURITY.md guidance.

## Ports and sidecars

Playwright drives `http://localhost:3140` (WebAuthn RP id `localhost`) while the
process binds `127.0.0.1:3140` (see `src/boot.rs` / `end2end/playwright.config.ts`
`PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`). Live reload uses the leptos reload port beside that bind.
Keeps clear of product hosts on `:3000`–`:3001` and the lepton kit harness on
`:3120`–`:3121`.

On boot the host starts these, or reuses them when something is already listening:

| Sidecar | Bind | Role |
|---------|------|------|
| Mock OIDC | `127.0.0.1:5556` | OAuth IdP for sign-in and account linking |
| SMS HTTP sink | `127.0.0.1:8099` | Captures SMS OTP (`HttpCaptureSmsAdapter`) |

Email goes to **Mailpit** (SMTP `1025`, API `8025`), which you have to start
yourself. Anything that reads a code out of email needs it up first: the confirm
funnel, email change, and password reset.

```bash
docker compose -f ../../../L1-host-stack-kits/lepton/infra/mailpit/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Delivery is synchronous. No Boson runtime is installed, so a code is readable from
Mailpit or the sink as soon as the action returns.

## Run

```bash
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target-lepton-uf-app
# From the lepton-uf-app workspace root. Builds SSR + hydrate (wasm-split for
# Lazy /user routes), then Playwright.
cargo leptos end-to-end --split --project lepton-uf-app-e2e
```

Do not interrupt the end-to-end run. It stops on its own when Playwright finishes.

To watch the browser, serve in one terminal and drive Playwright in another:

```bash
cargo leptos watch --split --project lepton-uf-app-e2e
# other terminal (WSLg or a display is required on WSL):
cd lepton-uf-app-e2e/end2end
npm ci && npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:headed
```

## Seeding

`POST /api/test/seed-data` is mounted for the harness only. Never mount it on a
production host. Scenarios and builders live in
[`lepton-test-support`](../../../L1-host-stack-kits/lepton/lepton-test-support/):
`auth_basic_user`, `auth_unverified_user`, `auth_confirm_*`, `auth_reset_token`,
`auth_user_with_totp`, and siblings.

Shared Playwright helpers live in [`end2end/shared/`](end2end/shared/) (`seedTestData`,
`signInAs`, `signupNewUser`, Mailpit and SMS readers). Specs import from
`end2end/tests/fixtures.ts`, which re-exports that folder.

## Product Playwright catalog

| Spec | Scenario IDs |
|------|----------------|
| `profile.spec.ts` | `pw-profile-update-happy`, `pw-profile-empty-name-sad`, `pw-profile-anon-redirect-sad` |
| `profile_photo.spec.ts` | `pw-profile-photo-upload-happy`, `pw-profile-photo-reject-sad` |
| `appearance.spec.ts` | `pw-appearance-save-happy`, `pw-appearance-anon-redirect-sad` |
| `account_email_password.spec.ts` | `pw-account-change-password-happy`, `pw-account-change-password-bad-current-sad`, `pw-account-change-email-happy`, `pw-account-change-email-invalid-sad` |
| `account_settings_composition.spec.ts` | `pw-account-settings-composition-happy` |
| `shell_menu.spec.ts` | `pw-shell-anon-signin-opens-dialog-happy`, `pw-shell-signed-in-nav-profile-happy`, `pw-shell-signed-out-profile-gated-sad` |
| `auth_gate_modal.spec.ts` | `pw-auth-gate-modal-signin-opens-happy`, `pw-auth-gate-modal-signup-opens-happy`, `pw-auth-gate-modal-signin-unlock-happy`, `pw-auth-gate-modal-bad-creds-sad`, `pw-auth-gate-take-me-back-sad` |
| `auth_referer.spec.ts` | `pw-auth-referer-safe-happy`, `pw-auth-referer-gate-path-happy`, `pw-auth-referer-evil-sad` |
| `account_wipe_totp.spec.ts` | `pw-account-wipe-totp-happy`, `pw-account-wipe-totp-bad-code-sad` |
| `totp_enroll.spec.ts` | `pw-totp-enroll-happy`, `pw-totp-enroll-bad-code-sad` |
| `oauth_link_settings.spec.ts` | `pw-oauth-link-google-happy`, `pw-oauth-link-account-taken-sad` |

`pw-account-change-email-happy` requires Mailpit and asserts “Verification sent…” plus a message to the new address.

Profile photos use `POST/GET /api/files/*` on this host (`LocalDiskBlobStore` under `uploads/`).
Client `profile_id` on upload is a hint for the harness; production hosts must authorize
from the session (see workspace README Security → Host duties).

## Deferred to the kit (do not re-prove here)

Primary coverage for these stays in
[`lepton-auth-ui-e2e/end2end/tests/`](../../../L1-host-stack-kits/lepton/lepton-auth-ui-e2e/end2end/tests/):

| Concern | Kit scenario / spec |
|---------|---------------------|
| Confirm funnel (email, phone, banner, prompt resume) | `confirm_account.spec.ts` |
| MFA matrix at sign-in (TOTP, recovery, WebAuthn skip and reject) | `signin_mfa.spec.ts` |
| Passkey enroll, revoke, trusted browser | `devices.spec.ts` |
| OAuth sign-in and callback against the mock IdP | `oauth.spec.ts` |
| Step-up re-auth modal (password and TOTP ladders) | `step_up_modal.spec.ts` |
| Password-only account wipe | `account_wipe.spec.ts` (`pw-account-wipe-*`) |
| Route pages, dialog, logout, reset request and confirm | `auth.spec.ts` |
| Authenticator disable / regenerate recovery | `totp_enroll.spec.ts` (kit rows beyond product enroll) |

The `lepton-shell` integration tests `product_surface` and `shell_step_up_surface`
read source and assert that testids and server actions are still wired. They catch a
deleted testid, not a broken flow: they never render a page, run a server function,
or click anything. Treat them as composition smokes, not a substitute for the
Playwright rows above.

## Assets

`public/orbital-theme-baseline.css` is copied from Orbital's generated first-paint
baseline. Regenerate it from the `orbital` crate build when `LEPTOS_BASE_PATH` or the
theme tokens change.
